Variables:
	(Depot, Carrier)
	(Depot, Carrier, DisasterLocation)

	Input: Carriers I read myself, demand_tmpD (keys), inventory_tmpD (keys)

Objective Function:
	Probability * Time * (Depot, Carrier, DisasterLocation) product-sum
	+ Rampup_(Carrier) * (Depot, Carrier, DisasterLocation) product-sum

	Inputs: probs_tmpD, costD (be careful for infeasible values), rampup myself

Constraints:
	For fixed DisasterLocation 
		sum of (Depot, Carrier, DisasterLocation) = disaster magnitude

		Inputs: demand_tmpD

	For fixed Depot 
		sum of (Depot, Carrier) <= depot inventory

		Input: inventory_tmpD

	For fixed Depot & Carrier
		(Depot, Carrier) = sum (Depot, Carrier, DisasterLocation)

		Inputs: None

	for fixed Carrier
		(Depot, Carrier) < Carrier capacity

		Inputs: I read carrier capacity myself

	Nonnegativity 
		
		Inputs: None

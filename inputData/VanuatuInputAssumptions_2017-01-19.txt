142 miles
229 km

km/hr = 229/11 = 20 km/hr


truck costs = 120 USD / Cubic Meter

average cuibc meter / metric ton = 3.67 (ration of simple averages of 8 items)

Thus, truck costs = 120usd/CBM * 3.67CBM/1MetricTon = 440USD/metric ton per hour

Assumption: 6 hours back and forth per trip (given flood conditions)
cost = 440USD * 6 = 2640 per metric ton

4/23 Notes

f_solveStochLPDisasterGurobiSubLoc3 seems to be the only method actually called 

1. Accident or mistake?
1.a. f_solveStochLPDisasterGurobiCostConstraintSubLoc calls seem to be in code, but never reached

2. What's the purpose of f_solveStochLPDisasterGurobiSubLoc3 vs. f_solveStochLPDisasterGurobiSubLocScaleDemand
2.a. can we interchange them?

3. High level architecture questions

4. Recommendations for how to approach this problem
